**The 255 MWp Sunraysia Solar Farm is on track to be the largest solar farm in Australia this year. Between 350 - 400 people will be directly engaged by Decmil during the construction period with the accommodation camp running close to full occupancy as it continues to ramp up.**

New South Wales – Maoneng Australia (Maoneng), John Laing (JL) and Decmil (ASX: DCG) hosted the ceremony on-site in Balranald, NSW with Morris Zhou, Ray Davy, Scott Criddle and Duncan Jewell initiating the public sod-turning for the solar farm.

The event was graced by a ‘Welcome to Country’ from the Muthi Muthi Nation Traditional Landowner Representative – Mary Pappin Senior, together with the Infrastructure Development Director of Balranald Shire Council Ray Davy.

## Key Project Features

More than 755,000 solar panels (255MW DC) will be mounted onto Single Axis Tracking tubes.

More than 4,000 km of cables and 100,000 piles will be installed over a development footprint of up to 800 Hectares.

The solar farm is expected to generate approximately 529GWh of energy per year when commissioned; which is the equivalent to powering up to 50,000 households and offsetting approximately 430,000 tonnes of CO2.

The solar farm is connected to a 33/220kV substation co-located on-site where the energy is transferred to the Transgrid 220kV Balranald Substation. From there the energy is then transferred either towards Buronga/VIC or Darlington Point/NSW.

As part of the works, approximately 400km of new Dark Fibre will be installed between the Buronga and Darlington Point substations to improve communication and control of the solar farm.
