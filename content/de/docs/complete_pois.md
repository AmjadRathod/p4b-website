If you find a POI with missing information in GOAT, you can edit it in OSM-database by clicking the "Edit with OSM" icon.

This takes you directly to the corresponding POI in OSM iD Editor.

Now you can enter the missing information or change information if it is incorrect. Save your changes as described in [Making changes in OSM](../osm_tutorial/).
