summary: The three planning workshops were conducted in the municipalities of Fürstenfeldbruck
  and Freising and at TUM. Experts from different backgrounds such as city planners,
  transport planners, architects, and politicians participated in these workshops
  and contributed to the further development of GOAT.

## Background

This year, the accessibility instrument GOAT has been experiencing continuous development within the support of the research initiative [mFUND](https://www.bmvi.de/DE/Themen/Digitales/mFund/Ueberblick/ueberblick.html). Our main goal in this project is to make GOAT an outstanding tool to help planners and decision-makers when planning for active mobility. The project started with an intensive development process and was followed by a series of [test cycles in the municipality of Fürstenfeldbruck](../2020-05-25-testcycles), which was followed by three planning workshops in Fürstenfeldbruck, Freising, and Munich (TUM internal). Finally, there will be a second workshop in Munich with a wide array of practitioners in October of this year and a concluding final synthesis workshop with partners from all municipalities.

We are very thankful to the participating city planners, transport planners, architects, and politicians who have contributed with their precious feedback to the development of GOAT.

## The procedure of the planning workshops

All three planning workshops lasted around three hours and were conducted following a similar agenda. First, GOAT was introduced to the participants so they could familiarize themselves with the main features of the tool. The project team then presented the planning questions that had been prepared for the respective contexts in consultation with the local planners beforehand. The participants formed groups based on their interests and worked on the planning questions. A special challenge was the COVID-19 situation, but an in-person workshop was favored and potential risks were mitigated by keeping distance and wearing masks.

## Answered planning questions

The planning questions were based on real planning tasks from each municipality. Among them:

* **New development areas**: Scenario for new residential development with local supply (e.g. kindergarten, supermarket) and additional path connections
* **New pedestrian and bicycle bridges**: Scenario development for new bridges and comparison of the accessibility effects at different locations
* **Barrier-free reconstruction of a pedestrian bridge**: Development of scenarios for the barrier-free reconstruction of a pedestrian bridge and effects on wheelchair accessibility
* **Location planning for local supply** (e.g. supermarket) and **mobility services** (e.g. Bikesharing and Mobility stations): Comparison of different locations through accessibility analyzes with heatmaps and multi-isochrones

The following illustration shows the results of one exemplary planning question. It deals with the effects of densification on a rural community in terms of accessibility and therefore it pictures a typical challenge in urban and transport planning.

## Feedback

While processing the planning questions and during the feedback round, the participants had many good ideas for improvements.
Some selected examples are:

* Integration of additional data (aircraft noise map, green spaces)
* Insert a size label when drawing new buildings
* Allow to label scenarios and add the possibility to switch different scenarios on and off
* Improved import and export functionality of scenarios
* Provide the option to change the attributes of existing streets
* Enable to model the influence of construction sites (e.g. temporary road closures) on accessibility
* Provide the possibility to export the heatmap
* Make it simpler to compare the isochrones of different modes

The suggestions were documented carefully and will be, wherever possible, implemented in the further development process. Some of the features are even already in development and will be released soon (see our [GitHub](https://github.com/goat-community/goat)). The planning workshops will be followed by a final synthesis workshop with participants from all municipalities and further experts. This last workshop within the mFund-project will be used to get further feedback on the user experience and derive conclusions for the future development path of GOAT.
