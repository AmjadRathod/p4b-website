## Release 1.0

We are happy to announce that we successfully launched version GOAT1.0. Therefore, we are one step closer to our goal of GOAT becoming a useful planning instrument to shape livable communities.

  
This milestone was enabled by a one-year funding from the research initiative [https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/GOAT.html](https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/GOAT.html "mFund"), which was provided by Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. Our aim was to improve GOAT and to include new features, which are adapted exactly to the needs of practitioners.

Now, after one year, the project is successfully finished and we are happy to share GOAT version 1.0 with all new features that we have developed within this project. Some selected examples are:

\- bicycle routing

\- scenarios on land-use changes, such as adding, deleting or modifying \[POIs\](../tutorials/scenario-location/) (e.g. placing a new Kindergarten) and \[buildings\](../tutorials/scenario-buildings/) (e.g. model how well a new residential area is served with daily needs)

\- ([https://vimeo.com/411741106](https://vimeo.com/411741106 "Mapillary street view images")) that help practitioners to view the local situation and find shortcomings

\- implemented high variation of \[different spatial data sets\]([https://vimeo.com/user93657565](https://vimeo.com/user93657565 "different spatial data sets")), such as environmental data, accident data, mode share (only for Munich), street level quality (street crossings, perceived cycle path quality assessed by ([https://www.munichways.com/](https://www.munichways.com/ "https://www.munichways.com/")), speed limits, etc.) and land use data (from ATKIS and OpenStreetMap)

\- enabled data import and export

\- usability improvement as suggested by the practitioners

\- various backend improvements

## Key Project Features

More than 755,000 solar panels (255MW DC) will be mounted onto Single Axis Tracking tubes.

More than 4,000 km of cables and 100,000 piles will be installed over a development footprint of up to 800 Hectares.

The solar farm is expected to generate approximately 529GWh of energy per year when commissioned; which is the equivalent to powering up to 50,000 households and offsetting approximately 430,000 tonnes of CO2.

The solar farm is connected to a 33/220kV substation co-located on-site where the energy is transferred to the Transgrid 220kV Balranald Substation. From there the energy is then transferred either towards Buronga/VIC or Darlington Point/NSW.

As part of the works, approximately 400km of new Dark Fibre will be installed between the Buronga and Darlington Point substations to improve communication and control of the solar farm.
