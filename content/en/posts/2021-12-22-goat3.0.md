## GOAT 3.0

We are happy to announce we got the grant for our new project [“GOAT 3.0”](https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/goat-3-0.html). The Project is funded with a total of 535.770 € by the [Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure](https://www.bmvi.de/DE/Home/home.html) as part of the [mFUND](https://www.bmvi.de/EN/Topics/Digital-Matters/mFund/mFund.html) innovation initiative.   The project's aim is to expand GOAT’s capabilities for the next 3 years starting November 2021. This expansion will take the form of different activities and concepts that we’d like to share with you!

## Many new features

The objective of GOAT 3.0 is to enhance the current functionalities by including further transport modes, additional destinations and by providing new indicators that visualize the analysis in a smart way. Therefore, we will work closely with several main partners including the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.mos.ed.tum.de/en/sv/homepage/), [Leibniz Institute for Ecological and Regional Development Dresden (IÖR)](https://www.ioer.de/), [Prof. Schaller UmweltConsult GmbH (PSU)](https://www.psu-schaller.de/), and [Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund GmbH (MVV)](https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/). 

We will enable GOAT for several new functionalities including: 
-	Accessibility analysis for public transit, car as well as on-demand transport and intermodal trips (B+R, P+R) 
-	Developing an aggregated 15-minute city score
-	Planning for green and open spaces 
-   Incorporation of more spatial datasets and smart visualization

## Development process
 
As a basis for developing the new indicators, we will conduct a nationwide survey on perceived spatial accessibility. Further, we will organize numerous citizens’ workshops and district walks with partner regions (City of Fürstenfeldbruck, City of Freising, City of München, City of Bonn, County of München, Metropolitan Region of Rhein-Neckar and many more) who are experts in the participation process.

Based on the findings, we will develop the new features in an iterative and co-creative process. In a minimum of 20 test and application workshops, the GOAT will be used in three partner regions (Munich region, Rhein-region, Görlitz region) in addition to around 60 stakeholders from municipalities, planning offices and transport companies, for real planning questions. Their feedback will be used in the development process and thus assist us to shape our tool and its new functionalities. 

The new functions are released step by step as beta versions and can thus be tested directly by the users. The final release of the GOAT 3.0 will take place at the end of the project in 2024. In addition, a total of at least 30 different data sets will be merged in the application and thus put into value, as well as data refined and made openly available.

## Research Objectives

In course of this project, we want to answer the following research questions: 
-	How can a digital accessibility tool be developed which combines differentiated analysis in real time and with an easy-to-use interface?
-	What are the requirements for a digital planning tool for the design processes within a city?
-	What added value does GOAT 3.0 provide for the planning field?
-	What strategies can we use to more efficiently put the results into practice? What hurdles regarding data, technology, and economic efficiency will arise?


## Stay tuned!

We are more than happy that this research grant enables us to hire our first two full-time employees: Elias and Grigorii! We feel honored by the high interest in our tool and the possibility to work together with such great partners that will bring in their expertise to jointly develop GOAT further.

We are looking forward to 3 exciting years and are eager to share our new features! Can't wait to try out the new features? Feel free to approach us and take part in one of our workshops.
