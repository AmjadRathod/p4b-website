## How it all started

Our common journey started in research at the TUM, more specifically at the [Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Planning](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/sv/homepage/). We were and still are very enthusiastic about the development of GOAT and its ability to help change the way cities are built by using the concept of accessibility and the power of digital maps.

The hard and intensive work on building [GOAT](../../what-is-goat) culminated in an enormously useful accessibility instrument, which will facilitate planners and decision makers to plan better for walking and cycling. 

We are absolute certain that new directions of work are necessary for continuous development and the application in practice to build more sustainable and balanced cities and regions worldwide. Therefore, we founded our start-up and chose a self-explaining name for it: Plan4Better!

Our core [team](../../../team) consists of Elias Pajares, Ulrike Jehle and Majk Shkurti and our expertise lies in the fields of environmental engineering, urban and transport planning, GIS expertise and software development.

## Our Motivation

What was our motivation to found a start-up? It is founded on four pillars: firstly, as already mentioned, we want to contribute to sustainable mobility. The second is our commitment to contribute to open data as well as to open source. Furthermore, we want to bring innovation to practice and in practical terms, we want to support municipalities in the planning process by crafting and providing map-based digital tools to build a balanced future for municipalities. 

We summarize cutting-edge analyses in an enjoyable and easy-to-use interface in our tools. All in all, we pursue the vision, that Plan4Better becomes the hidden champion to design sustainable and attractive spaces. We already had the opportunity to present our tool to numerous practitioners from different municipalities and we received an overall overwhelming positive feedback, so we decided to go all in! 

## Our Offer

The business concept includes distributing GOAT as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) by providing individualized versions of GOAT as custom versions worldwide. In addition, we will subsequently set-up GOAT on a larger scale, starting with regions in Germany, and offer easy access by a subscription model. In future this will be available for several countries in Europe. 

Our portfolio incorporates also additional services linked to data management and supply as well as WebGIS development and consulting. Finally, we will provide professional training on the use of GOAT and novel data collection methods (OSM, Mapillary) for our customers, who are primarily urban and transport planners, location planners, politicians and scientists.

GOAT is urgently needed, as the industry is lacking digital planning tools which are mature, dynamic and affordable. GOAT is a dynamic planning support system that is transferable to different study areas and comparable tools are not on the market so far. 

Besides, GOAT excels performing sophisticated analyses via an intuitive web interface, which allows everyone to use it without long training. The tool uses novel methodologies to analyze the current situation and model future scenarios, which increases efficiency in planning. 

GOAT provides cities with a solid and fact-based decision-making tool for sustainable transport and urban planning. This strengthens in-house competencies of the respective establishment that uses it, which results in better decision-making and therefore better public spending. 

Our start-up adventure just started, and we are very excited about it. Nonetheless, we will continue the development of the tool as we received many requests for new features by practitioners who have already tested it and are using GOAT for real planning tasks. With the founding of the start-up, our activities are getting a new drive. Despite that, we will stay committed to our core values, such as open-source development, and to our network. We also aim for a strong collaboration with TUM as this is where it all started.
