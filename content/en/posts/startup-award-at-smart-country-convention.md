Great news – we are the winners of the startup award in the category smart city of the [Smart Country Convention in Berlin](https://www.smartcountry.berlin/en/ "Smart Country Convention")!

In just three minutes pitch and two minutes of questions by an expert panel, we were able to convince the jury of our digital planning tool GOAT. We highlighted the potential of GOAT to help plan the construction of new primary schools in the area where it is most needed.

Many thanks to the jury consisting of Sven Butler, Dr. Franka Birke, Eric Weber, Christian Rickerts, and the audience, who could vote interactively!

We are happy about the positive feedback towards our evidence-based planning tool! It gives us confidence that we are on the right path and encourages us to continue working on our tool.

A big kudos to [Bitkom ](https://www.bitkom.org/EN "Bitkom")for the good organization and the interesting event – we enjoyed being part of it!

We wish the fellow finalists [Treesense ](https://treesense.net/ "Treesense")and HEIDI all the best and want to thank them for the exciting competition!
