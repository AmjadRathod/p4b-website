## Our successful MobiData BW Hackathon participation

Last year we participated in the MobiData BW Hackathon and were one of the winning teams with our “Walkability Index”! Our team members were Elias Pajares (our “innovation partner”), Ulrike Jehle, Majk Shkurti, Grigorii Ivanov and Rafael Leonardo Munoz Nieto.

The hackathon took place on 27.-29th November and was organized by the Ministry of Transport of Baden-Württemberg, the City of Freiburg and, the Public Transport Company of Baden-Württemberg. The event pursued the goal of developing new solutions for future mobility. In total, 150 participants were tackling 30 different challenges. As a sustainable future mobility is something that we also aim for, we were happy to roll up our sleeves and start coding for a good cause!

## The Course of the Event

Inspiring input talks on Friday marked the perfect start of an exciting event which went on with the presentation of the different challenges. This was followed by the team building, then the main programming and working phase was on! On Saturday the minister of transport, Winfried Hermann, and the major of Freiburg, Martin Horn, participated in the event by initiating the working day with an encouraging wake-up call. After 36 hours of coding and very few hours of sleep, we were excited to pitch our results on Sunday.

## Our Challenge: “Walkability Index”

We tackled the challenge “Walkability Index” and developed a respective prototype, named WALKability IndEx (WALKIE), and an algorithm to calculate potential pedestrian flows: (This [video ](https://vimeo.com/485063701 "GOAT - MobiData BW Hackathon - Walkability Index")shows our developed prototype). As one of the lucky winners, we receive a 3-month funding from the Ministry of Transport Baden-Württemberg as part of a follow-up grant to the "MobiDataBW Hackathon 2020" hackathon to establish our developed prototype.![Förderung durch Baden-Württembergs Ministerium für Verkehr](/images/forderung_bw.png "Gefördert durch Baden-Württemberg")![Logo von MobiData BW](/images/mobidata_bw.png "MobiData BW")
