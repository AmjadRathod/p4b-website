## Our new office in WERK1

## The surrounding area: The Munich Werksviertel

Our new office is located in Munich's Werksviertel - centrally located near Ostbahnhof and the perfect place for startups. In addition to being a center for digital business and innovation, the Werksviertel also offers space for creativity, culture, social engagement and leisure. We are particularly excited about the focus on sustainable urban development, as the Werksviertel ([https://werksviertel-mitte.de/](https://werksviertel-mitte.de/ "https://werksviertel-mitte.de/")) relies on the combination of converted industrial buildings and new construction.

This week we were able to move into our office in WERK1 ([https://www.werk1.com/coworking-muenchen-werk1/](https://www.werk1.com/coworking-muenchen-werk1/ "https://www.werk1.com/coworking-muenchen-werk1/")), "The Startup Friendliest Place in Munich". We are very happy that we now have our own place with Plan4Better to work together on our planning software GOAT (/what-is-goat/) and other exciting projects.

## Goodbye, Colab

With every new beginning comes a small farewell: We are leaving the Munich Urban Colab and therefore have to say goodbye to our Colab friends. The Munich Urban Colab has given us a lot of space for innovation, the development of our start-up and good conversations. Thanks to everyone for the cool time!

## Accessibility of the WERK1 / Plan4Better office

Of course, we first checked the accessibility from WERK1 in GOAT. Despite the large rail axis at Ostbahnhof, the area has good connectivity for walking and biking. Our daily commute to the office, passing many stores, restaurants and venues, is through an attractive pedestrian zone. We are also optimally connected to public transportation through the Ostbahnhof station.

We are excited about our time at Werk1 and look forward to every visit. The coffee machine is already ready!
