Within the project [WALKIE](../../posts/2021-04-06-walkability-index/), we developed a Walkability Index that shows how attractive paths are for pedestrians. This index can be used to identify shortcoming in the local walking path network. 

The Walkability Index consists of 22 items, that are clustered in 6 categories:

![Items and weights of the Walkability Index](/images/docs/walkability_index/indicators.png "Walkability indicators and weighting factors")

The weighting of the items is done based on several scientific studies (....) and according to the data availability. For some items (e.g. sidewalk width), data availability in Open Data sources, such as OSM, is very limited. Therefore, these items are excluded from the index calculation. 

Also after omitting these items, not all the information to be included in the index is available for all paths. If information is missing for one item or a whole category, it is therefore omitted and the other items or categories are given a higher weighting.
